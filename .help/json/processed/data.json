Imagine AI not just helping us with social media, but also analyzing our friend groups and suggesting who to reach out to. Sounds handy, right? But it makes me wonder: will this make our relationships feel more real, or push us apart?\n\nWhat do you all think about AI getting involved in our social lives? Good thing, or just gonna make us feel more isolated? Anyone tried using AI to boost their social game? I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7nc7jrr94wd1.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba06721d1f2262cb4b37cba9842670ce8934e4ff",

This would be one API call just to get the context summary.\n\nI then provide this summary as the context for the actual prompt and actual text composing I want the model to do (second API call).\n\n**I am brainstorming for better ways to do this and I would welcome your ideas.**\n\nMy current approach also has downsides, such as the context summaries not including the whole picture (which may or may not be an issue), but also the first API call still suffers from the increased token usage over time, as the correspondence increases.",
